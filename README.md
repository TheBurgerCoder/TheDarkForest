The code for my submission to the Congressional App Challenge 2023

Note that my actual submission isn't changing because of these updates, they are just to make it a better game as my friends and family do play it

- Update 1 - Code was supposed to be in folder format, so the js had to be updated to have the correct file locations
- Update 2 - I didn't fix them all accidentally, all images should now render properly
- Update 3 - Fire now speeds up when you change the speed, but the sound doesn't yet
- Update 4 - Fire sound now speeds up with game, but gets really distorted the slower and faster it is. Monsters can now jumpscare you without looking at their wall, change made because several people wanted it
- Update 5 - Points and clock now move at twice the speed relative to the monster's movemnt, so it should be easier now. I tried making it from 1000ms to 750ms, but it was still too hard, so now it's only 500ms
- Update 6 - All monsters now play the jumpscare noise, but half as loud, and then they all now adjust when the speed is changed
- Update 7 - Repo moved to TheBurgerCoder/TheDarkForestGame
