# TheDarkForest.github.io
The code for my submission to the Congressional App Challenge 2023

Update 1 - Code was supposed to be in folder format, so the js had to be updated to have the correct file locations\
Update 2 - I didn't fix them all accidentally, all images should now render properly\
Update 3 - Fire now speeds up when you change the speed, but the sound doesn't yet
